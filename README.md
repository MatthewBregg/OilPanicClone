=====================
Gameplay

The goal is not let any drops hit the ground.

To do this, use the mousewheel to move the bucket back and forth.
However, the bucket can only hold 3 drops.
It must be emptied with space when over the collector device.
A life is lost if a drop hits the floor, or the bucket overflows.
A point is gained whenever drops are emptied into the collector, and when a drop is caught.
